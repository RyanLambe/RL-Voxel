# Update
Due to school work picking up, this project was abandoned before it was completed. I still intend to come back to it at some point, but for now I have other ideas that I'm more curious about exploring.


# RL-Voxel

This will be a Realtime Raytraced Voxel Rendering Engine using OpenGL. 

## Goals:

- Realtime
- Raytraced
- Voxel Perfect


### Voxel Perfect:

Voxel Perfect refers to the term Pixel Perfect, when every pixel is locked to the same grid. Similarly this engine will display everything on the same voxel grid, this is especially important for Entities as they typically are what drift away from the grid, the camera will not be locked to the grid as that would create jittery motion.
