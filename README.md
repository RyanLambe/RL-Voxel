# RL-Voxel

Realtime Raytraced Voxel Rendering Experiment using OpenGL. 

## Goals:

- Realtime
- Raytraced
- Voxel Perfect


### Voxel Perfect:

Voxel Perfect refers to the term Pixel Perfect, when every pixel is locked to the same grid. Similarly this engine will display everything on the same voxel grid, this is especially important for Entities as they typically are what drift away from the grid, the camera will not be locked to the grid as that would create jittery motion.
